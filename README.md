# War Of Knights

War Of Knights is a LibGDX desktop videogame with local network multiplayer.

## How to play

This is a local network 2-player game. To play you can:
* Run one client on two different machines + the game server on a third PC (all in the same network).
* Or have the server and all the clients running on the same PC.

This last scenario isn't ideal to play but is more than sufficient to test the game. You can find the executables inside the folder `./jar`.

> Note that you must install Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on your machine. The game was only tested on Windows PCs".
